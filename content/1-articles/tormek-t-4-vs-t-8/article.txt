I am trying to decide between Tormek T-4 and a T-8.

Here are some differences I have identified.

## Hollow-grinding, amount of hollow.
Both grinders will produce a hollow-grind. The main advantage is that hollow-ground blades are easier to hone, and the main disadvantage is that there is less metal supporting the cutting edge.

A deeper hollow will make it easier to hone, but also reduce the metal support. The T-4 has a 200mm diameter wheel, while the T-8 has a 250mm diameter wheel. I've read that some people prefer the T-8, because the amount of hollow is less.

How much less though? For a 3mm thick blade ground at 25 degrees, the 200mm wheel should produce a hollow of 0.06mm. With a 250mm diameter wheel, the hollow should be 0.05mm deep. For further comparison, a typical bench grinder has a 150mm wheel, and that will produce a hollow of 0.08mm.

## Wheel width
The T-4 has a 40mm wide wheel, the T-8 has a 50mm wide wheel. While the extra width is nice, because less lateral movement is required, even with a 50mm wide blade, it'll still need to be moved laterally on the wider wheel.

## Duty cycle
The T-4 is rated to run for 10,000 hours at 30 minutes per hour. The T-8 is rated to run continuously for 25,000 hours.

Sounds like the T-4 is sufficient for my requirements

## Leather honing wheel
The T-4 has a 145mm diameter honing wheel, the T-8 has a 220mm diameter wheel.

For my woodworking tools, I don't plan to use the honing wheel. For knives, I think there won't be a big difference.
