## Out of the box
- blade damaged
- cap iron poorly finished
- handle would not fit
- sole not flat
- body poorly finished

## Blade
- reground the primary bevel
- honed a secondary bevel
- created a slight back bevel (Charlesworth ruler trick)
- takes a good edge
- holds edge very well
- have read that the steel is HSS
- blade edges are roughly cut, easily relieved with a sanding block

## Cap iron
- lapped the bottom edge
- smoothed out the top surface
- cannot set too far forward without creating clogging problems
- cap iron screw is really ugly

## Handle
- rough finishing
- planed to fit

## Sole
- used a plane to flatten it laterally, and to take out the larger high spots
- brass mouth piece gets in the way of the plane
- lapped on a glass plate with sandpaper, went reasonably quickly

## Body
- have read that it's Shungee rosewood, but this one looks more like beech or oak
- wedge and handle look closer to Shungee rosewood in their other planes
- toolmarks and overall finishing poor
- mouth opening is quite large for a smoothing plane
- but clogging is a problem, possibly due to poorly finished throat wear area
- sides are not perpendicular to the sole, problem if you plan to use on a shooting board, easily solved with a plane

## Performance
- easy enough to adjust
- haven't been able to get super-fine cuts yet
- not comfortable to use yet
- need to camber the blade
- works well in both pull and push orientations
